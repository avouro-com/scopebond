Each delivery batch's record numbers are now signed with the computer's enrolled key. The Cloud exporter takes an optional `sequenceProof` (the attester and the machine credential's id) and sends `seq_proof: { kid, signature }` beside `seq` and `queue`, over `"scopebond:delivery-sequence/v1\n"` followed by the canonical JSON of the credential id, the queue id, the numbers and the SHA-256 of each receipt as sent. A party holding only the bearer credential can no longer attach numbers to records of its choosing. The hook and the agent sign with the key that signs their receipts; an exporter without a key sends the numbers unsigned, as before.
