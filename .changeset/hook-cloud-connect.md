"@scopebond/hook": minor

Add Cloud connect + auto-export to `@scopebond/hook` (connector session C). A connected hook mirrors every signed receipt to a Scopebond workspace so activity appears in the hosted portal, with no change to the local decision.

- `scopebond-hook connect <workspace-url> <enrollment-bundle.json>` enrolls the machine's countersigning key with the workspace using the portal's one-use handoff (reusing the gateway's `completeCloudEnrollment`), scaffolds the machine if needed, and stores a scoped machine credential in `.scopebond/cloud.json` (ignored from git).
- When connected, `createHookRuntime` wraps its receipt store with the gateway's durable Cloud exporter (`SqliteCloudOutbox` + `createCloudExporter`): delivery is best-effort and never blocks a tool call, receipts are retained locally and retried if the workspace is unreachable, and a short bounded flush keeps the hot path fast (`SCOPEBOND_HOOK_FLUSH_MS`, default 800 ms).
- `scopebond-hook flush` delivers anything still queued — run it on a session-end hook for zero per-call latency.
- `scaffold` now also writes `.scopebond/.gitignore` so keys, the Cloud credential and the local log are never committed. New exports: `connectCloud`, `loadConnection`, `attachExporter`, `flushBounded`, `connectionPath`, `HookConnection`.
