Add element-wise array parameter bounds to `action_allowlist`. A param bound may now be `{ "items": <scalar bound>, "match": "all" | "any" }`, where `items` (`enum` / `min` / `max` / `pattern`) is applied to each element of an array parameter: `match: "all"` (default) requires every element to satisfy it, `match: "any"` requires at least one. This makes path policy expressible — e.g. deny a `pr.merge` whose `paths` touch `infra/prod/**` via `{ "paths": { "items": { "pattern": "^(?!infra/prod/).*" }, "match": "all" } }`.

Fail-closed: a bounded array parameter that is absent or not an array denies; an empty array vacuously satisfies `match: "all"`. Array bounds are mutually exclusive with a top-level scalar bound, and `match` is only valid with `items` — enforced by `validatePolicy` and the JSON schema. Existing scalar bounds and policies are unchanged. Unblocks the GitHub App boundary connector's path-policy conformance.
