hook: every rules check now reports what this computer runs for each rule (blocks or records) and who set it (the workspace or the person at the computer), so the workspace can show what is true on the computer. On a computer its workspace manages, `rules enforce <rule>` and `rules monitor <rule>` apply only where the workspace allows changes on computers (`local_changes` in the rules document); otherwise the command says the workspace sets the rule and changes nothing. Either way the workspace hears the result immediately. Scopebond's own protection is unaffected.

agent: on Windows the launcher restarts an agent that stopped with an error after 30 seconds, up to 50 times, as launchd and systemd already do on macOS and Linux; a clean stop still ends it.
