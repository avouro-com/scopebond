gateway, hook: two coding agents on one computer no longer make each other's checks fail with "database is locked". A process now ends with a passive checkpoint instead of an exclusive truncating one (which waited for every other process and blocked writers meanwhile), and waits up to 15 seconds for the write lock instead of 5. A lock that still times out says what it is, instead of suggesting `init`.

agent: an update hands over reliably. Hook entries move to the recommended hook before the agent updates itself, so a failed handover never leaves the hook behind, and the old agent exits within 5 seconds even if stopping its window or tray hangs, instead of staying alive while its replacement waits.
