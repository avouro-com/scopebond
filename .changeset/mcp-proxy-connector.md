"@scopebond/mcp": minor

Add `@scopebond/mcp` — the MCP proxy connector (a leaf package). It sits in-path between an MCP client and an upstream Model Context Protocol server, checks each `tools/call` against policy before it is forwarded, and records a signed **PEP-authorized** receipt; a denied call returns a JSON-RPC error and is never forwarded.

- The pure `createMcpProxy({ policy, principal, server, attesterKeyPem, upstream })` returns `{ handle(message) }`: `tools/call` is mapped to the taxonomy `mcp.tool.call` action (arguments digested, never stored) and decided with `@scopebond/verify`; everything else passes through. The proxy decides the caller's request with no agent signature, so its receipts are `pep_authorized` — the identity is the configured principal.
- `scopebond-mcp` is a stdio proxy: point your MCP client at it and give it the real server after `--`. It correlates upstream responses by id, fails closed on any error, and can append signed receipts to a local log.
- Conformance vector (allowed call forwarded with a `pep_authorized` allow receipt, denied call blocked and never forwarded, tool-bound and passthrough) proves the decision path with an injected upstream.
