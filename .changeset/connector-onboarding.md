Connector onboarding helpers so the MCP proxy and framework guard go from install to working in one step.

- `@scopebond/mcp`: `scopebond-mcp init --server <id>` scaffolds a signing key and a starter policy (allow non-destructive tools on that server, deny delete/write/remove/drop by name); `starterMcpPolicy(server)` is exported for library use.
- `@scopebond/framework`: `generateAgentKey()` returns a fresh Ed25519 PKCS#8 PEM, and `starterToolPolicy(names)` builds an allowlist policy over `tool.<name>` types — so a guard can be scaffolded in code.
