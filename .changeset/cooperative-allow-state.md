Add a `cooperative_allow` execution state to the receipt evidence contract. It records that an action was evaluated and allowed by policy but **not executed by the gateway** — the model for cooperative (M0 / check-only) enforcement, where the agent performs the action itself. Such a receipt is always `executed: false` with `external_effect: "not_independently_verified"`, so a cooperative allow is never labeled as executed. The verdict engine (`violates`) is unaffected: it evaluates the `executed` flag, not the execution state.
