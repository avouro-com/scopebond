Add the receipt evidence class (GATEWAY_SPEC §15 / D65): every receipt can carry an additive `evidence_class` of `signed_intent`, `pep_authorized` or `boundary`, so a verifier, the workspace and exports say how strong the evidence is without over-claiming.

- `@scopebond/policy-schema` extends the closed `receipt.schema.json` with optional `evidence_class`, `principal` (required for `pep_authorized`) and `boundary` (`gate` ∈ merge/deploy/egress/platform_event, `outcome_ref`, `attribution` {kind: asserted|inferred, actor}; required for `boundary`), enforced by conditional schema rules, and exports `EVIDENCE_CLASSES`, `BOUNDARY_GATES`, `ATTRIBUTION_KINDS` and their types.
- `@scopebond/gateway` tags its own signed-intent receipts explicitly, classifies legacy receipts at read time (`signed_intent` when an agent signature is present, else `pep_authorized`), and **never upgrades** an explicitly set class. `verifyReceipt` now reports `evidence_class` and rejects a receipt whose class-required fields are missing or whose foreign class fields are smuggled in. New exports: `classifyEvidenceClass`, `EVIDENCE_CLASSES`, `BOUNDARY_GATES` and the `EvidenceClass`/`BoundaryGate`/`BoundaryEvidence`/`PepPrincipal` types.

The envelope is otherwise unchanged and receipts emitted before this field still verify. A boundary-receipt builder is intentionally left to the boundary connector that will consume it.
