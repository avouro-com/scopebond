Add Cloud connect + auto-export to `@scopebond/mcp`. `scopebond-mcp connect <workspace-url> <enrollment-bundle.json>` enrolls the proxy's signing key with a workspace (reusing the gateway's `completeCloudEnrollment`) and stores a scoped machine credential next to the key. When connected, the running proxy mirrors every PEP-authorized receipt to the workspace through the gateway's durable outbox (`SqliteCloudOutbox` + `createCloudExporter`), flushing on the proxy's lifetime and on shutdown. New exports: `connectCloud`, `loadMcpConnection`, `openExporter`, `connectionFileFor`, `McpConnection`.
