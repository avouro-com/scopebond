Every next step the CLI prints is in the form the person's system runs. On Windows: an expired, denied or failed sign-in prints the exact `npx.cmd … login <workspace>` command to run again; "Node too old" gives the `winget` command and how to find an older Node that still comes first on PATH; `doctor` says when PowerShell's script policy blocks plain `npx`/`npm`/`scopebond-agent` and that the `.cmd` forms work without a policy change; the agent's autostart fixes, usage line, install hint and help use `scopebond-agent.cmd` / `npm.cmd`; and the warn-mode hint names `scopebond-agent.cmd autostart on`. New helpers: `agentCommand`, `npmGlobalInstall`, `nodeTooOldLines`, `loginAgainCommand`, `executionPolicyAdvice`, `explainPowerShellError`.
