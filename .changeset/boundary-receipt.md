Add signed boundary receipts. The evidence contract gains a `boundary` authorization mode — a clean representation for a receipt with **no agent signature**, where a gate attested a consequence and the identity is the receipt's boundary attribution (previously a boundary receipt would have had to misuse `insecure_development`). `@scopebond/policy-schema` adds the matching `authorization` variant to the closed receipt schema.

`@scopebond/gateway` exports `buildBoundaryReceipt(input, attester)` — a reusable builder for any boundary-lane connector that constructs and signs a `boundary`-class receipt (gate, outcome_ref, attribution, the verdict and the pinned policy), mapping the verdict to an honest execution state (`deny` → `denied`, `allow` → `cooperative_allow`, `not_evaluated` → `observed_not_evaluated`, always `executed: false`).

`@scopebond/github-action` uses it: with a signing key configured (`SCOPEBOND_ATTESTER_KEY`), the PR check emits a signed boundary receipt per PR head, verifiable offline, signed with the customer's own key in their runner. A `not_evaluated` (human) pull request emits none.
