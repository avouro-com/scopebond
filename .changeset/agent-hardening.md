"@scopebond/agent": minor

Autostart now starts a launcher that finds Node and the agent each time (no window on Windows), the agent follows the versions its workspace recommends (installing a newer agent and restarting, or holding when the workspace says so), keeps the Scopebond hook entries current and repaired, and runs a signed daily end-to-end self-check. New `scopebond-agent check`; `status` shows the version, autostart health and the last self-check. Dependencies are pinned exactly, so one agent version always runs one hook version.
