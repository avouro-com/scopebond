# @scopebond/agent

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 464b80a: New package `@scopebond/agent`, the Scopebond Agent: one resident process per user that delivers the records the hook queued, runs the rules check (workspace rules, the queue report and credential renewal), notices agent settings that lost the Scopebond hook entry and repairs them on request, and reports `scopebond.status.v1` on a token-protected local channel (`127.0.0.1`, token in `~/.scopebond/agent.json`). `scopebond-agent autostart on` starts it with the user's sign-in on Windows, macOS and Linux, without administrator rights. The hook keeps deciding every action without it.

  The hook exports the delivery-state, status and credential-renewal functions the agent reuses.
