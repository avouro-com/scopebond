# @scopebond/policy-schema

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ed6a822: Add Action Taxonomy v1 — the coding, GitHub, MCP and HTTP action types and their parameter bounds, as an extension of the policy vocabulary. `@scopebond/policy-schema` ships the machine-readable registry at `registry/actions-1.0.json` (exposed via the `./registry` subpath) with 11 action types (`shell.exec`, `file.read`, `file.write`, `git.push`, `package.install`, `net.fetch`, `http.call`, `mcp.tool.call`, `pr.open`, `pr.merge`, `deploy.release`), each declaring typed parameters, bound-ability, a risk class and emitting connectors. New exports: `actionRegistry`, `TAXONOMY_VERSION`, `getActionType(id)` and `validateActionParams(type, params)` (a structural parameter check — required present, declared parameters correctly typed; unknown types are reported, never silently allowed). Parameters are carried under `intent.params` and bound-able ones are constrained by an `action_allowlist` clause's `param_bounds`.

  `@scopebond/verify` adds taxonomy verdict conformance vectors (`vectors/taxonomy-verdicts.json`) proving the scalar bounds — enum, pattern, boolean-as-enum, omitted-parameter-denies — and the closed-allowlist deny of an unlisted action type, with no change to the `violates` engine. Array-parameter (e.g. `pr.*` `paths`) element-wise bounds are not yet expressible by `param_bounds` and await a separate vocabulary decision.

- 27be98a: Add element-wise array parameter bounds to `action_allowlist`. A param bound may now be `{ "items": <scalar bound>, "match": "all" | "any" }`, where `items` (`enum` / `min` / `max` / `pattern`) is applied to each element of an array parameter: `match: "all"` (default) requires every element to satisfy it, `match: "any"` requires at least one. This makes path policy expressible — e.g. deny a `pr.merge` whose `paths` touch `infra/prod/**` via `{ "paths": { "items": { "pattern": "^(?!infra/prod/).*" }, "match": "all" } }`.

  Fail-closed: a bounded array parameter that is absent or not an array denies; an empty array vacuously satisfies `match: "all"`. Array bounds are mutually exclusive with a top-level scalar bound, and `match` is only valid with `items` — enforced by `validatePolicy` and the JSON schema. Existing scalar bounds and policies are unchanged. Unblocks the GitHub App boundary connector's path-policy conformance.

- 973507f: Add signed boundary receipts. The evidence contract gains a `boundary` authorization mode — a clean representation for a receipt with **no agent signature**, where a gate attested a consequence and the identity is the receipt's boundary attribution (previously a boundary receipt would have had to misuse `insecure_development`). `@scopebond/policy-schema` adds the matching `authorization` variant to the closed receipt schema.

  `@scopebond/gateway` exports `buildBoundaryReceipt(input, attester)` — a reusable builder for any boundary-lane connector that constructs and signs a `boundary`-class receipt (gate, outcome_ref, attribution, the verdict and the pinned policy), mapping the verdict to an honest execution state (`deny` → `denied`, `allow` → `cooperative_allow`, `not_evaluated` → `observed_not_evaluated`, always `executed: false`).

  `@scopebond/github-action` uses it: with a signing key configured (`SCOPEBOND_ATTESTER_KEY`), the PR check emits a signed boundary receipt per PR head, verifiable offline, signed with the customer's own key in their runner. A `not_evaluated` (human) pull request emits none.

- 6417866: Add a `cooperative_allow` execution state to the receipt evidence contract. It records that an action was evaluated and allowed by policy but **not executed by the gateway** — the model for cooperative (M0 / check-only) enforcement, where the agent performs the action itself. Such a receipt is always `executed: false` with `external_effect: "not_independently_verified"`, so a cooperative allow is never labeled as executed. The verdict engine (`violates`) is unaffected: it evaluates the `executed` flag, not the execution state.
- 8ad0aab: Add the receipt evidence class (GATEWAY_SPEC §15 / D65): every receipt can carry an additive `evidence_class` of `signed_intent`, `pep_authorized` or `boundary`, so a verifier, the workspace and exports say how strong the evidence is without over-claiming.

  - `@scopebond/policy-schema` extends the closed `receipt.schema.json` with optional `evidence_class`, `principal` (required for `pep_authorized`) and `boundary` (`gate` ∈ merge/deploy/egress/platform_event, `outcome_ref`, `attribution` {kind: asserted|inferred, actor}; required for `boundary`), enforced by conditional schema rules, and exports `EVIDENCE_CLASSES`, `BOUNDARY_GATES`, `ATTRIBUTION_KINDS` and their types.
  - `@scopebond/gateway` tags its own signed-intent receipts explicitly, classifies legacy receipts at read time (`signed_intent` when an agent signature is present, else `pep_authorized`), and **never upgrades** an explicitly set class. `verifyReceipt` now reports `evidence_class` and rejects a receipt whose class-required fields are missing or whose foreign class fields are smuggled in. New exports: `classifyEvidenceClass`, `EVIDENCE_CLASSES`, `BOUNDARY_GATES` and the `EvidenceClass`/`BoundaryGate`/`BoundaryEvidence`/`PepPrincipal` types.

  The envelope is otherwise unchanged and receipts emitted before this field still verify. A boundary-receipt builder is intentionally left to the boundary connector that will consume it.

- 1260a51: Add signed PEP-authorized receipts, completing the three-class receipt model. The evidence contract gains a `pep` authorization mode — the honest representation for a receipt with **no agent signature** where a proxy/PEP decided a request carrying the caller's own identity; the identity is the receipt's `principal`. `@scopebond/policy-schema` adds the matching `authorization` variant to the closed receipt schema.

  `@scopebond/gateway` exports `buildPepReceipt(input, attester)` — a reusable builder for any M1/PEP connector (the MCP proxy, gateway interceptors). It constructs and signs a `pep_authorized`-class receipt (the normalized action, the principal, the verdict and the pinned policy), mapping the verdict to an honest execution state (`deny` → `denied`, `allow` → `cooperative_allow`, `not_evaluated` → `observed_not_evaluated`, always `executed: false`). Like the boundary class, it attests only that the PEP authorized the action for the principal — never agent non-repudiation.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 875d640: Publish one strict canonical JSON implementation and use it for verifier hashes and signatures across the Scopebond packages.
- Load the schema documents through bundleable JSON modules so strict validation also runs in edge Workers.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release: the Scopebond policy vocabulary JSON Schemas (policy document
  and `scopebond:receipt`) and the deterministic `scopebond-verify` verdict library —
  `violates(policy, receipts, claimed)` with full v1 clause coverage and the reference
  conformance vector suite. Published as the early open standard (spec + vectors)
  ahead of the proxy.
